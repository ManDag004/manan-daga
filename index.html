      <p>As a Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of British Columbia, I bring a blend of analytical rigor and technical proficiency to the world of software development and data analysis. My educational journey is marked by a perfect Major GPA and placement on the Deanâ€™s Honour List, reflecting my commitment to academic excellence and my passion for harnessing data to solve complex problems.</p><br>
      <p>My technical toolkit is comprehensive, encompassing a range of programming languages and frameworks, with a particular emphasis on Python, Java, and React/React Native. I thrive in environments that challenge me to build and innovate, as demonstrated by my proactive development of a React Native app that facilitated the vaccination process for thousands during the pandemic, and my role in various projects that required both technical know-how and creative problem-solving.</p><br>
      <p>In the collaborative sphere, I have a proven track record of working effectively with cross-functional teams, ensuring that the user experience is at the forefront of product development. My project work, like the UBC Course Scheduler, showcases my ability to streamline complex processes, making them more accessible and efficient for end-users.</p><br>
      <p>As I advance in my career, I am eager to explore opportunities that allow me to leverage my statistical analysis capabilities and my knack for software development to drive innovation and create impactful solutions. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on future technological ventures.</p>
